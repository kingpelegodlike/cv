To transform your plain text CV into a beautiful and shareable HTML page, you have two options:

I. Use Github Pages to publish it online
Delete the existing gh-pages branch from your fork. It will only contain this webpage. You can either use git or the Github web interface.
Create a new branch called gh-pages.
Head to yourusername.github.io/markdown-cv to see your CV live.
Any change you want to make to your CV from then on would have to be done on the gh-pages branch and will be immediately rendered by Github Pages.
